title: Building a Community of Practice 
---

<h2>Building a Community of Practice</h2>
<p>
    In this post we set out the steps we have taken to build the NHS Data Science community into a community of practice, and highlight the opportunities we created for new members to get involved with the running of the community.
</p>

<h2>NHS Data Science Community for Heath and Care</h2>
<p>
  The NHS Data Science Community board meetings will meet monthly. It will govern and provide a check and challenge function on project teams and will act as the parent group to any future sub-committees and technical advisory groups that form.
Board members are appointed for a 1-year term. Before the next financial year, the Board will vote on a fair procedure that will elect the next term's board members.
In accordance with communities' commitment to the principle of openness and transparency, the board summary notes will be published online the communities GitHub page.
</p>
<h2>Current Members:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Alex Cheung - NHSE/I</li>
  <li>John O'Connell - NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit</li>
  <li>Suki Panesar - NHSE/I</li>
  <li>Julia Wilkins - The Health Economics Unit</li>
  <li>David Sgorbati - The Health Economics Unit</li>
  <li>Tim Parnell - The Health Economics Unit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Executive Team</h3>
<p>
  We are expanding the Data Science community team with new roles to create an executive group that can take forward the work building a community of practice. These are volunteer roles (as are all roles in the community) but require an appropriate level of time commitment: i.e., approximately two hours per week.
</p>

<p>We were particularly looking for early-carers / apprentices / trainees who want to get involved. In this case, enthusiasm is more important than experience.</p>
