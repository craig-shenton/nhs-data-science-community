title: Building a Community of Practice 
---

<h2>Building a Community of Practice</h2>
<p>
    Here we set out the steps we will take to build the NHS Data Science community into a community of practice.
</p>

<h2>NHS Data Science Community for Heath and Care</h2>
<p>
  The NHS Data Science Community board meetings will meet monthly. It will govern and provide a check and challenge function on project teams and will act as the parent group to any future sub-committees and technical advisory groups that form.
Board members are appointed for a 1-year term. Before the next financial year, the Board will vote on a fair procedure that will elect the next term's board members.
In accordance with communities' commitment to the principle of openness and transparency, the board summary notes will be published online the communities GitHub page.
