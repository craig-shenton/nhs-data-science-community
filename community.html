title: Building a Community of Practice 
---

<h2>Building a Community of Practice</h2>
<p>
    In this post we set out the steps we have taken to build the NHS Python community into a community of practice, and highlight the opportunities we created for new members to get involved with the running of the community.
</p>
<h3>What is a community of practice?</h3>
<p>
    Communities of practice have been set up to bring together teams across government who share common job roles, responsibilities or remits, but otherwise are working in departmental/organisational silos. Their aims are to foster communication, interaction,
    and provide opportunities to share knowledge, ideas and experience.
</p>
<p>
    Both the Central Digital and Data Office and the Government Digital Service in the Cabinet Office have developed resources over the years to help new communities of practice get started.

<h2>NHS Data Science Community for Heath and Care</h2>
<p>
  The NHS Data Science Community board meetings will meet monthly. It will govern and provide a check and challenge function on project teams and will act as the parent group to any future sub-committees and technical advisory groups that form.
Board members are appointed for a 1-year term. Before the next financial year, the Board will vote on a fair procedure that will elect the next term's board members.
In accordance with communities' commitment to the principle of openness and transparency, the board summary notes will be published online the communities GitHub page.

<h3>Executive Team</h3>
<p>
  We are expanding the Data Science community team with new roles to create an executive group that can take forward the work building a community of practice. These are volunteer roles (as are all roles in the community) but require an appropriate level of time commitment: i.e., approximately two hours per week.
</p>

<p>We were particularly looking for early-carers / apprentices / trainees who want to get involved. In this case, enthusiasm is more important than experience.</p>
