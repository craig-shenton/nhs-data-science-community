<h2>NHS Data Science Community for Health and Care</h2>
<h3>Wecome to our communtiy of practice. Find out how you can get involved.</h3>
<p>The Data Science community is a place where health and care professionals can find and share knowledge and resources as part of an active community, showcasing real-world examples and applications of the latest developments in data science in collaboration with NHS England's <a href="">AnalystX programme</a>.</p>

<p>The Data Science community will focus on the delivery of machine learning and deep learning and later will bring in AI elements into our framework.</p>

<h2>Executive Team</h2>
<p>
  We are expanding the Data Science community team with new roles to create an executive group that can take forward the work building a community of practice. These are volunteer roles (as are all roles in the community) but require an appropriate level of time commitment: i.e., approximately two hours per week.
</p>

<p>We were particularly looking for **early-carers** / **apprentices** / **trainees** who want to get involved. In this case, enthusiasm is more important than experience.</p>
